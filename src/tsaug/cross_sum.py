    Parameters
    ----------
    X : numpy.ndarray
        Time series to be augmented. Matrix with shape (n,), (N, n) or (N, n,
        c), where n is the length of each series, N is the number of series,
        and c is the number of channels.

    Y : numpy.ndarray, optional
        Binary labels of time series, where 0 represents a normal point and 1
        represents an anomalous points. Matrix with shape (n,), (N, n) or (N,
        n, cl), where n is the length of each series, N is the number of
        series, and cl is the number of classes (i.e. types of anomaly).
        Default: None.

    inds : numpy.array, optional
        Indices of time series to sum with. Matrix with shape (N, m), where N
        is the number of series, and m is the maximal number of series to sum
        with each series. The i-th output series is the sum of the i-th input
        series and the ind[i][j]-th time series for all j. Values of ind[i][j]
        can be NaN for series to be summed with less than m series.

        Augmented time series and augmented labels (if argument `Y` exists).
